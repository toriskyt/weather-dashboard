When the user opens the page they are presented with a search button and input box.

When the user searches for a city using the input box, the city will appear on the right-hand side along with a weather icon, the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index for the city.  The UV Index will indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe using a color-code model.

Underneath the display, there are four cards showing the weather for the next five days.
